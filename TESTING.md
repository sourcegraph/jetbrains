    public static String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
    ```
2. Select function and use `Cody | Commands | Generate Docstring`.

#### Expected behaviour

* User is automatically switched to `Chat` tab.

#### Expected behaviour

* User is automatically switched to `Chat` tab.
* Chat responds with **potential issues** and **suggestions** like missing nullability checks or input sanitization (
  response may vary).

## Chat

### Autoscroll to latest message

1. Fill the `Chat` with messages until the scrollbar appears.
2. Scroll all the way down.
3. Add new message.

#### Expected behaviour

* Scrollbar is **automatically** scrolled to the bottom. New message tokens are visible.

### Read chat history without interruptions

1. Fill the `Chat` with messages until the scrollbar appears.
2. Scroll up. Latest message should be not visible or partially visible.
3. Add new message.

#### Expected behaviour

* Scrollbar is **not moving automatically** while new message tokens are generated. You can easily read older messages
  without interruptions and scrolling is smooth.

### Organize multiple chats

You should be able to organize multiple chats and follow up previous conversations.
Cody should "remember" your questions and chat responses, even after closing IDE.

#### Happy path

1. Start a new chat
2. Send message similar to `my favorite color is blue`
3. Close IDE
4. Run IDE and open previous conversation
5. Ask `what's my favorite color?`
6. Response should be similar to `your favorite color is blue`

#### (optional) Test ideas

Useful tips:

* Transcripts in `runIde` mode are located in `build/idea-sandbox/config/options/cody_history.xml`.
* You can force-save transcript by using the `Ctrl` + `S`.

Test ideas:

1. Delete "active" chat. You should be able to delete the currently opened chat. Messages should be removed from Chat tab.
2. Restore historical chat, focus on chat input field and use UP/DOWN keys to cycle between previous questions.
3. Press "new chat" as fast as you can. Especially during the IDE startup.
4. Switch between chats as fast as you can.
5. Press "new chat" while being inside Subscription panel or something other than Chat tab. Tabs should switch automatically.
6. Use commands/recipes inside empty, new chat. Verify serialization/deserialization.
7. Ask about codebase to force response with listed context files and verify if everything is correctly serialized/deserialized. Links to context files should be clickable.
8. Remove all chats using history UI. File with transcripts should disappear.
9. Use only the keyboard. For example, navigate transcripts with arrows, delete, enter.
10. Start typing while being focused on Chat History to perform search-by-title.
11. Open multiple chats and ask few simultaneous questions in several sessions at once.

## Code Search

All `Code Search` actions are available under the same `Sourcegraph` right-click context menu, so for simplicity, we describe only the **Expected behaviours**.

To open the context menu:

1. Open a file in the repository that is indexed by Sourcegraph.
2. Select the fragment of code you want to search for (for example: `System.out.println` or `println` may be the simplest candidate).
3. Right-click on selected fragment, navigate to the `Sourcegraph` sub-menu and choose one of the actions.

### Find with Sourcegraph...

// todo, it's not working for me

### Search Selection on Sourcegraph Web

#### Expected behaviour:

1. The browser is launched.
2. The result is a list of fragments that are found in **all indexed repositories**.

### Search Selection in Repository on Sourcegraph Web

#### Expected behaviour:

1. The browser is launched.
2. The result is a list of fragments that are found **within the same repository** from which the searched fragment originates.

### Open Selection on Sourcegraph Web

#### Expected behaviour:

1. The browser is launched.
2. The result is a **single indexed file** from which the searched fragment originates.
3. The line with fragment is visible and there is no need to manually scroll to it.

### Copy Sourcegraph File Link

#### Expected behaviour:

1. A link is copied to the clipboard.
2. Notification pops up with successful message.
3. After pasting the link into the browser, the Code Search page opens with the file and the exact line from which the searched fragment originates.

## [Product-led growth](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/data-analytics/product-led-growth/)

### Cody Free/Pro subscription tab

1. Log in to Sourcegraph.com with a **Free** account and `cody-pro-jetbrains` feature flag enabled.
2. Go to the `Cody` toolbar and open `Subscription` tab.
3. Verify:
    * The current tier should be `Cody Free`.
    * The `Upgrade` button is visible and it points to `https://sourcegraph.com/cody/subscription`.
    * The `Check Usage` button is visible and it points to `https://sourcegraph.com/cody/manage`.

8. Verify: `Subscription` panel is not visible in `Cody` toolbar.
9. Go to accounts settings and switch back to the **Free** account.
10. Verify: `Subscription` panel is visible.

### Cody Free/Pro rate limit errors

1. Log in to a Sourcegraph.com with a **Free account with rate limits exceeded**.
2. Go to the `Chat` and type a message.
3. Verify: A notification about the exceeded rate limit is shown. It should suggest upgrading to Cody Pro.
4. Trigger autocomplete in the editor.
5. Verify: A similar notification is shown to the user.

## Other

### Automatic repository recognition

1. Open project with enabled Git VCS. This repository must be publicly available on GitHub.
2. Open to `Cody` toolbar.
3. Click on repository button to open `Context Selection` dialog. Button is placed inside `Cody` toolbar on left, bottom
   corner.

#### Expected behaviour

* Repository `Git URL` has been successfully inferred from VCS history. Value is similar
  to `github.com/sourcegraph/jetbrains`.

### Persistent custom repository

1. Open project with enabled Git VCS. This repository must be publicly available on GitHub.
2. Open to `Cody` toolbar.
3. Click on repository button to open `Context Selection` dialog.
4. Change `Git URL` to a different, valid Git URL repository.
5. Click `OK` button and restart IDE.
6. Navigate again to `Context Selection`.

#### Expected behaviour

* Repository `Git URL` is same as before restart.

### Colour scheme changes

1. Ask Cody Chat question to which it will reply with various layout elements (list, code snippets, etc)
2. Change theme in settings or using Themes action.
3. Verify that chat text is readable, as well as that there is clear colour distinction between user and assistant
   sections. Both sections colors should also correspond to the chosen theme.

Repeat the above starting from different themes.

#### Expected behaviour

Changing theme should lead to full repaint of the colours according to the current theme.
